# Practice Assignment: Fundamentals I

### Learning Objectives:

- Implement programming logic such as loops and conditionals to solve problems using C# syntax in a console application.
##
### Directions
Create a new .NET console project and complete the exercises outlined below. For the entirety of this course, you will be expected to submit GitHub links or zip files of your entire project folder!

- [x] Create a loop that prints all values from 1-255.

- [x] Create a new loop that generates 5 random numbers between 10 and 20.

- [x] Modify the previous loop to add the random values together and print the sum after the loop finishes.

- [x] Create a new loop that prints all values from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3 OR 5, but NOT both.

- [x] Modify the previous loop to print "Fizz" for multiples of 3 and "Buzz" for multiples of 5.

- [x] Modify the previous loop once more to now also print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5.

- [x] (Optional) If you used for loops for your solutions, try doing the same with while loops. Vice versa if you used while loops!
