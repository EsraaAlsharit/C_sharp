### Directions
For this assignment, we are going to build a virtual storefront as a sort of capstone project. It will be a site that displays listings of products for sale with the ability to add customers who order those products. Following the wireframe below, try to replicate the functionality of an E-commerce website. Feel free to add your own features to build this into a more fleshed-out website!
