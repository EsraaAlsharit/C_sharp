# Core Assignment: Chefs 'N Dishes

### Learning Objectives:

- Construct a One-to-Many relationship between two models using Entity Framework Core.
- Pull relationship data between models using EF Coreâ€™s Include method.

##

### Directions

- Build out the application as detailed below. Take note that while this assignment also uses Dishes, you should make a new database for this project because the Dish table has some different requirements than what was seen in CRUDelicious.

**Chef validations**

- All fields are required
- Date of Birth must be in the past
- Bonus: Chef must be at least 18 years old to be added (this will take research!)

**Dish validations**

- All fields are required
- Calories must be greater than 0
- Tastiness must be between 1 and 5
