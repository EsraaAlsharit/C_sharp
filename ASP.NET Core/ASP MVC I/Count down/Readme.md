# Practice Assignment: Countdown

### Learning Objectives:

- Research how to display and compare dates and times.
- Apply that research to render results on a View.
##
### Directions
This assignment is twofold: it is meant to test the skills you already have as well as the skills you might not! From time to time we will ask you to complete a research assignment where we will ask you to do something that is NOT in the platform.

This is because your real life as a programmer will include many hours spent researching things you do not know that you are being asked to integrate into a project for work.

Today, you are being asked to create a countdown. The end date will be hard-coded from your back-end, but the start date should be whatever the current day and time are.

You can get the current time and day like so:

```md
DateTime CurrentTime = DateTime.Now;
````
You will need to research a few things to make this project work:

1. How do I display a formatted date and time?
1. How do I compare two dates against one another?
1. How do I render the results of that comparison in a user-friendly way?

This assignment is meant to challenge your ability to seek out answers and apply them correctly. Remember though that what you figure out might be different than what someone else finds. This is a great assignment to compare against your classmates and see what others discovered! You may find an even better way to do it by seeing an example someone else found. Or you may be that person who found a really neat and clever way to solve it and you get to teach it to others! Embrace the opportunity to learn and grow with your classmates!

If you do need some assistance in getting started, here are some recommended lines you can plug into Google's search engine:

- C# how to format DateTime
- C# how to compare two DateTimes

- [x] Visually recreate the wireframe

- [x] Research logic to format and compare DateTimes

- [x] Apply logic to make the page functional
