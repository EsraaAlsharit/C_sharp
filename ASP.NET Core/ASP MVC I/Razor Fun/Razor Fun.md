# Practice Assignment: Razor Fun!

### Learning Objectives:

- Render a View using Razor in a simple web application.
- Apply C# logic to render data on our View.
- Bonus: Apply conditional logic to affect how data renders.
##
### Directions
Using what you have learned about switching between C# logic and HTML, replicate the following wireframe. Create a new string List. Then iterate through the List. Generate a <p> tag for each iteration, and place the contents of the string from your List within the inner text of the <p> element.

Bonus: If the string in the List begins with the letter "c", style the <p> element with red text! (Do this using inline style for now since we have not gone over how to bring CSS files into our projects just yet.)

- [x] Create a web application that renders a cshtml page.

- [x] Add a List of strings to Index.cshtml using Razor.

- [x] Loop through the values in the List and print each one out in a p tag.

- [x] Bonus: If the string in the array begins with the letter "c", style the p element with red text.
